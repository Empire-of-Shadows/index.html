  Privacy Policy for Stygian-Relay

  Last Updated: November 10, 2025

  This Privacy Policy describes how Stygian-Relay ("the Bot") collects, uses, and stores information.

  1. Information We Collect
  To provide its services, the Bot collects and stores the following information:
   - Server Information: We store Discord Server (Guild) IDs and Channel IDs to configure and manage message
     forwarding rules.
   - User Information: We store Discord User IDs to associate users with the configurations they create. We do
     not collect or store usernames, email addresses, avatars, or any other personal user information.
   - Configuration Data: We store the forwarding rules and settings created by users for their servers.

  2. How We Use Information
   - To Provide the Service: The collected data is used exclusively to provide the Bot's core functionality,
     such as forwarding messages according to the rules you set.
   - To Save Settings: Your server's configuration is saved in our database so your settings persist.
   - To Improve the Service: We may use anonymized and aggregated data to monitor usage and improve the Bot's
     performance and features.

  3. Message Content
  The Bot needs to read message content in configured channels to perform its forwarding function. However,
  the content of user messages is never stored in our database or logged. The content is accessed temporarily
  in memory solely for the purpose of relaying it to the destination channel.

  4. Data Storage and Security
  Configuration data (including IDs and rules) is stored in a secured database. We take reasonable measures to
  protect the information we store from loss, theft, and unauthorized access.

  5. Data Retention and Deletion
   - Configuration data is retained as long as the Bot remains in your server. When the Bot is removed from your
     server, you may request the deletion of all associated data.
   - You can request to view or delete your server's data at any time by contacting us.

  6. Information Sharing
  We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your server's or users' data with any third parties.
