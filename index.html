    <h1>Privacy Policy for Stygian-Relay</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 10, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Stygian-Relay ("the Bot") collects, uses, and stores information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide its services, the Bot collects and stores the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Server Information:</strong> We store Discord Server (Guild) IDs and Channel IDs to configure and manage message forwarding rules.</li>
        <li><strong>User Information:</strong> We store Discord User IDs to associate users with the configurations they create. We <strong>do not</strong> collect or store usernames, email addresses, avatars, or any other personal user information.</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration Data:</strong> We store the forwarding rules and settings created by users for their servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide the Service:</strong> The collected data is used exclusively to provide the Bot's core functionality, such as forwarding messages according to the rules you set.</li>
        <li><strong>To Save Settings:</strong> Your server's configuration is saved in our database so your settings persist.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve the Service:</strong> We may use anonymized and aggregated data to monitor usage and improve the Bot's performance and features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Message Content</h2>
    <p>The Bot needs to read message content in configured channels to perform its forwarding function. However, the content of user messages is <strong>never stored</strong> in our database or logged. The content is accessed temporarily in memory solely for the purpose of relaying it to the destination channel.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Configuration data (including IDs and rules) is stored in a secured database. We take reasonable measures to protect the information we store from loss, theft, and unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Configuration data is retained as long as the Bot remains in your server. When the Bot is removed from your server, you may request the deletion of all associated data.</li>
        <li>Users can request to view or delete their server's data at any time by contacting us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your server's or users' data with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to request data deletion, please join our support server discord.gg/gzBKqCQBhG.</p>
